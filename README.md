/*Android Daneshjooyar Project */

This Project has a CLI that is the admin account that can add Students and Teachers and etc...
The cli sends the data to the database that is the "file"
and the server receives the data from the database

Now the databse Sends the data to the server and the server sends the data to Frontend
Now flutter receives the data with a socket in each page Needed 

The data received is normally a String we split the String 
The splited String is sent part to part to showcase
Each Page has  a background for better UI 

Cli is implemented with txt and sql

The sql is better to save data cause it doesnt need that much classes and plus it runs faster with less code and it is
Easier to understand 

Hope the Project is helpfull !
